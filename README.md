Logic and Architecture Modularity and Usability: Separating code into components increases the modularity of the application. This is the maximum support and maintenance code, allowing you to reuse components in applications of different parts.

Separation of Concerns: Each component is responsible for its specific function. This is in line with SOLID principles and best development practices.

Performance: Using <canvas> to animate a large number of objects (for example, raindrops) is more efficient than handling DOM elements. <canvas> allows you to draw graphs directly, which reduces the load on the browser and improves performance.

Smoothness of Animation: Animations on <canvas> often look smoother, especially with a large number of objects.
